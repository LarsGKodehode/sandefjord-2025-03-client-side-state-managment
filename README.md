# Client Side State Management

A showcase for how one can use [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) to manage states that should be shared by all components in your application (Global State).

**Reminders**:
- If you have state that should have multiple instances concurrently, this is likely not the solution.
- If you want the user to be able to share state between multiple devices or browsers, you need a backing database, not this.
